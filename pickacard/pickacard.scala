  hand you were dealt, you win; otherwise, you lose.

What is the strategy that optimizes your chances of winning?

  // The problem is, we have incomplete information.   
  // The key is correctly identifying that the card you have is the max card.
  // It is very easy to screw up.  For example
  // (56, 30, 76,  40,  12, 60, 45, 58, 72, 14)
  // The max came early, in the third slot.  At that point, the odds
  // of the max being 76 was only 13%.   So we kept going and never
  // hit a new local max
  
  // We can also miss the other way.  What about the following case
  // (56, 30, 70, 40, 12, 74, 29, 80, 12, 85)
  // Where do we stop?
  // When we drew 70 with card 3, that only had a 7% chance of being the high, so we kept going
  // On card 6, we drew 74.  This had a 27% chance of being high.  Probably keep going
  // On card 8, we drew 80.  This had a 61% chance of being high.  We would probably stop there.
  // But unfortunately, on card 10, we drew an 85. 
  
  // What this shows is that, if there is a 50% chance of the current card being
  // the maximum, and you chose to draw another, your chance of winning becomes < 50%,
  // because even if the low card is in the face down cards, you may not identify it when it comes.
  
  // Rule 2:  If the chance of your current card being max is 50% or more, stop.
  
  // There is still room for improvement.  But I don't know how to quantify it right now.
  // Instead, I think we will need to simulate it, and try tuning that 50% lower
